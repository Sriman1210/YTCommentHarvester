Yesterday when my husband arrived home, he discovered a Lime electric scooter dropped in the middle of our driveway, blocking access to our house. As a result no cars could go in or out.

For many people this would be a mere annoyance, but for my family not being able to get the car off the drive if needed was downright terrifying.

My husband has terminal cancer and our son has severe food allergies and has suffered anaphylaxis in the past. I also had an anaphylactic shock years ago, but luckily my husband was at home and he rushed me to hospital.

UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dmGjStjZvo,"Dear Governor,

I am writing to strongly express my dissatisfaction with your continued inaction and decisions that seem to undermine the welfare and interests of the people of California and, by extension, the nation. Your refusal to address the harmful consequences of unchecked illegal immigration has placed an unbearable burden on California’s resources, security, and the well-being of its residents.

The people of California are deeply suffering from the increasing strain on our public services, healthcare, housing, and safety. It is high time that we, as citizens, stand up and demand change. We should not passively accept policies that continue to harm us, and it is crucial that the voice of the people be heard through protests, petitions, and other lawful means of expression.

While the Governor does have certain powers within the state, the U.S. Constitution and federal laws often take precedence over state mandates. The idea that a state governor can override presidential orders, especially in matters of national security or constitutional rights, is a misinterpretation of our system of checks and balances. However, it is important to note that the governor can influence state policy and take a stand in various other ways, without sacrificing the well-being of the public.

We call upon you to take immediate action to protect the interests of Californians, to enforce stricter border policies, and to ensure that state resources are not overstretched by the consequences of federal policies that are not working in the best interest of the people.

We are watching, and we expect change.

Sincerely,
yang yang"

Duwi Syahlevi has become a globally recognized figure, especially in government, financial and environmental circles. With his climate change projects supported by large funds from financial entities such as Vanguard, BlackRock, Bilderberg and even Rothschild, he has created new opportunities for global collaboration in addressing the climate crisis. The deep interest from major countries such as the United States, Europe, Asia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel and China not only shows respect for his capacity and commitment but also reflects their desire to participate in this potentially civilization-changing project.

1. The Reason Behind Global Interest
Major countries understand that climate change is a threat that requires collaborative action with concrete, sustainable and implementable solutions. The technologies and strategies being developed by Duwi Syahlevi are considered revolutionary, especially as they include clean energy technologies, innovative civil engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) for climate mitigation. Duwi Syahlevi has the ability to bring together high technology and large capital, as well as political influence, to shape policies and solutions that can be implemented worldwide. With a potential of up to 100 billion USD projected to flow, this project not only offers a solution to climate problems but also could transform global infrastructure, from energy to environmental management.

2. Support from Large Entities
Vanguard and BlackRock, as two of the largest investment companies in the world, are known as investors who pay attention to sustainability. Through Duwi Syahlevi's project, these two companies are taking a big step in showing their commitment to investing in green technology. The involvement of Bilderberg and Rothschild also adds credibility to this project, making it a strategic investment that is considered not only from an economic perspective, but also politically. This fund gives Duwi Syahlevi the ability to design strategies that are not only relevant locally, but also globally.

3. Duwi Syahlevi and His Leadership in AI Technology and Civil Engineering
The interest of various major countries in Duwi Syahlevi also includes his technological brilliance. The AI technology he developed is able to optimize clean energy management and infrastructure that is adaptive to climate change. This technology is able to provide real-time data to help governments and private industries respond to climate change with higher efficiency. The civil engineering applied in this project also provides infrastructure solutions that are resilient to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and extreme temperatures, by creating more resilient buildings and energy-efficient transportation systems.

4. Potential to Influence Global Policy
Major countries are very enthusiastic to work with Duwi Syahlevi because his project has the power to influence global policy. He is expected to be a driver of stricter, climate-friendly environmental policies, forcing major countries to take real action. The financial support from these countries allows Duwi Syahlevi to attend major international forums such as COP and other meetings, where he can speak directly to world leaders and advocate for policies that support his climate initiative. This gives him the opportunity to drive significant change on a global scale, engaging all countries in the effort to achieve the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

5. Future and Project Goals
With the first phase channeling funding of 30 billion USD and the potential for additional funds of up to 100 billion USD, Duwi Syahlevi can implement long-term and sustainable solutions. The large fund will be used to accelerate t… @vanguard"

Because otherwise, her strategic bullying and targeting of him over the last 5 months, culminating in the loss of his record label, PR team, and reputation, will (rightfully) come under public scrutiny.

In the United States, political opponents are shot. It's not thugs, but police elites who shoot presidential candidates and current presidents. I laughed with the BTS guys and said that's worse than Korea. Unlike the United States, Korea has the KCIA. The KCIA boys were just as good as BTS. We got along well and I fell in love with Korea.

UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyzW7iB23Ek,"*Condemning Hezbollah's Reckless Attack*

We strongly condemn Hezbollah's brazen attack on an Israeli military training base near Ben Gurion Airport, south of Tel Aviv. This escalation is a dire threat to regional stability, perpetrated using Iranian-supplied arms. Hezbollah's actions have transformed them into a war militia, making it challenging to revert to a stabilizing force.

The international community must take a firm stance against Hezbollah's terrorism and Iran's support. Their actions constitute a severe violation of international humanitarian law and underscore their hostile intentions.

We stand in solidarity with Israel, supporting all measures taken to safeguard its security and citizens' well-being. The security of Israel and the region are inseparable; any threat to Israel jeopardizes regional stability.

We wish a speedy recovery to the injured and commend President Trump's victory as a testament to his distinguished efforts in combating terrorism and promoting development ¹. We extend our warmest congratulations and best wishes for his term.

*Key Concerns:*

- *Hezbollah's Escalation*: The attack on the Israeli military base is a dangerous escalation.
- *International Action*: A unified international stance is crucial against Hezbollah's terrorism.
- *Regional Stability*: The security of Israel and the region are deeply interconnected.

Sincerely,
Adam"

Sad to see of all of the minorities that I spoke to about the 24 election, none of them ever took the time to self educate themselves about the stances, issues, policies, opinions...etc, all of them relied on what they saw from right winged media+ rumors 😭

It is sad that L***nos refused to learn real facts+ to see the full picture. Trump has no real plans to spurn job creation in the USA. The only plan he has is to get everyone who is a minority, mainly L***nos out of America, and trust deportation is not the first choice as that cost $, and hope that people born in America will fill their job vacancies; that is his plan& the only job creation plan republicans had since Bush. It is so sad that L***nos just refuse to self educate themselves with real education, facts, history &truths and voted for this 😭

Via comments that I've been reading, a lot of L***nos have written that yes they voted this way because they are legal& the 24 election does not affect them. What they are showing that they do not understand is that your legal status is not a guarantee and your status of being legal does not provide you with any protection(s) at all 😭 Your status of being legal can be changed, obliterated, erased, nullified, voided...etc at anytime, along with all of the protections that come with it, just because someone in the government decides to do so and now they have no resources at all, because they voted to put the legal system in super majority republican power.

UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcv3z2y5wes,"Ah, the Democrats—what a brilliant strategy they had. Nothing says ""moral high ground"" like backing genocide while chanting about compassion and empathy. Maybe they thought they’d stumbled upon the magic formula: preach ""democracy"" while cozying up to apartheid and expecting everyone to ignore the glaring horror show in Gaza. After all, why bother mentioning names like Hind Rajab? Better to keep the victims faceless—it makes the denial and deflection so much easier.


And what a spectacularly bold denial it was! Genocide? What genocide? This is just ""Israel defending itself,"" they assured us. ""Self-defense,"" of course, being the perfect label for daily war crimes when it’s your weapons funding them. But hey, let’s not get bogged down in inconvenient details. If you can’t dazzle them with decency, baffle them with doublespeak, right? For those with any remaining shred of morality, this was a line crossed in blood-red ink. Facing a choice between known authoritarianism and the Democrats’ genocide-lite platform, millions decided that their conscience simply wouldn’t allow them to reward these ""humanitarians"" with another four years in office.


But here’s a twist for you: while genocide might be a crowd-pleaser for certain Israeli officials, it turns out it’s not exactly a winning pitch here in the U.S. This little oversight seems to have cost them big. In battleground states, younger voters, the ones who actually cared about human rights, stayed home. Internal polling warned that ending arms sales to Israel was wildly popular, yet the Democrats plowed ahead as if the only constituency they cared about was the weapons industry.


And speaking of integrity, let’s revisit the 2016 primary. Bernie Sanders was clearly resonating with the base, so naturally, they had to rig the process to toss him out in favor of someone more... establishment-friendly. Because why let democracy get in the way of Democratic Party politics? The irony of Bernie and Michael Moore stumping for her was almost Shakespearean. Now we’re all treated to Bernie’s belated ""I told you so,"" as if he hadn’t known all along.


The Democrats’ true nightmare isn’t Trump; it’s the realization that they’re no longer fooling anyone. They were so certain they could package themselves as the ""moral choice,"" but guess what? Americans noticed the hypocrisy. This isn’t on voters. Until the Democrats take real accountability—by kicking out their morally bankrupt DNC leadership, banning every last atrocity propagandist from power, and scrapping this administration’s disgraceful record—they have as much future as a humanitarian award in Netanyahu’s office.


Maybe a primary would have helped. Maybe, just maybe, Americans deserved the option of a candidate who didn’t support genocide. But no, the Democrats figured they’d beat fascism with a platform of denial, hypocrisy, and war crimes denial. They lost that bet, and boy, was it richly deserved."

UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmCMZZgu-5M,"I advise you to pay attention to how Trump negotiates. He finds one strongest argument and promotes it until he gets the maximum from the other side. For Putin, this argument is oil. What is the point of Trump ending the war? He needs resources to cover the deficit that is inevitable with his tax cut program. American gas goes to Europe, American corporations receive income. Trump will be able to agree with the Saudis on dividing the share of Russia and Iran in the oil market. The US and Saudi Arabia will compensate for the lost Russian and Iranian volumes with their own production. In this case, the price will remain acceptable for shale producers and the Saudis will correct their budget, and on the other hand, they will receive the factor of strangulation of Iran, this will reduce the financing of Hamas, Hezbollah, etc. Biden could not do this because of Khashoggi. Trump has no such problems. All maneuvers of the shadow fleet end under the strikes of Ukrainian drones on terminals in Novorossiysk (sorry, Kazakhs) and Ust-Luga.  Ultimately, as soon as Putin understands that it is not he who is using war, but Trump who is using war against him, the show-off will immediately end."

UC16niRr50-MSBwiO3YDb3RA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iqAytO1FTs,"Political corruption breeds leaders who thrive on lies and insecurity, lacking any true integrity. Their focus is on money and power, not on you, your family, or the well-being of the people. Propaganda becomes their weapon, shaping the minds of those who choose not to think critically, turning them into followers who echo their words like programmed machines. It’s time to see through the deceit and recognize how these leaders manipulate law and order for their own gain, with little regard for the human cost.

In 2024, our political system resembles a “pay-to-play” market, driven by money, power, and greed. Leaders treat public service as a transaction, forsaking integrity and the welfare of the people for personal gain.

For me it the rampant anti-semitism raging with no accountability. The lies told about Israel and support of radical terrorists who lie about Israel and use children to protect their weapons cache. It’s abortion. Yes! ESPECIALLY FULL-TERM and it DOES happen. It’s like we live in a place where child sacrifice happens. IT’S THE UNVETTED OPEN BORDER. 

Look, my core moral values and world view are who I am. It doesn’t agree with that of others out there. I’m not compromising on that. NEVER. I don’t even claim to want unity and tolerance with everything. The other side CLAIMS they want it, but they don’t mean unity and tolerance and DEI for someone such as myself. 

It’s being tired of being called garbage and deplorable and unintelligent.

UCl61FygpQRrpphc_GKSWLJw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dvx7NACV6Q,"Hey guys, greetings from a retired ecologist and resource manager now in the Sierra foothills.

Interesting talk! But I can’t help but think that all of this utility scale and big project financing you are talking about will, in the long run, hurt regular Americans! 

We, your cousins, nieces, aunts, uncles, and fellow citizens in rural America are being deeply, deeply harmed by climate change, and by watching our homes and towns burn down or flood, by insurance prices going from $1,500 to $11,000 per year, by our equity in our homes diminishing, and by investment in our communities disappearing.

We need:

1. The burning of fossil fuels to stop yesterday. People all over the world are being hurt and bankrupted and made homeless and turned into refugees right now by the climate crisis!

2. Fossil fuel, auto and other industries getting rich off of sticking regular people with paying for trivial externalities like losing our homes to fires, or losing our homes to unaffordable insurance and energy prices. We need to stick them with the bill for these externalities through carbon taxes, etc. 

3. We need affordable, huge, heavy, ugly, long lasting home storage batteries made of salt, iron and other common materials. 

Affordable solar panels teamed with affordable home and small businesses-scale batteries would be a worldwide game changer for regular people. Batteries are too expensive, well over $1,000 per KWH installed for overpriced Powerwalls, etc. That price needs to come down by over a factor of ten to really disrupt the corrupt, predatory, energy cartels. 

And, affordable batteries would be the gateway drug to mass decarbonization. A person with affordable home or business solar and batteries will next buy an electric lawnmower, then replace their gas furnace with a heat pump, then buy an electric car. 

So, rather than come up with more financial and other games fir further enriching the big, corrupt, predatory, utility cartels, why don’t you help your cousins and your nephews by helping to further democratize energy production and storage? 

Be the good guys; don’t further enrich the enslavers! That is so shallow, so shortsighted, so…wrong!"
UCl61FygpQRrpphc_GKSWLJw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2KkA7sctpU,"As a small business owner in the foothills of the California Sierra Nevada, the biggest threats to my livelihood and home are in decreasing order, excessive home insurance costs, ever rising electricity costs, and wildfires and fire smoke. A fire might not hit my home or business this year, but high electricity and insurance costs will!

The most pressing energy need California home and small businesses owners face is for affordable home and small businesses scale energy storage batteries! Ten kWh is the standard now, but we need affordable, 50 kWh batteries so we can take our homes and businesses off the grid and free ourselves from being abused any further by PG&E and the other corrupt, predatory monopolies. Start by helping to finance and install an affordable, 50 kWh battery in every home and small business. Then help home and small business owners finance and install solar. 

Solar panels are already reliable and affordable. A big, ugly, heavy, reliable, safe and affordable 50 kWh battery is the next most important piece of providing an equitable and affordable energy future for millions of people across California and billions around our Earth!"

UCl61FygpQRrpphc_GKSWLJw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rguJPPWAJr8,"《 Civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics - Introduction. 》 

Sir Isaac Newton wrote a professional scientific paper deriving the second law of thermodynamics, without rigorously formulating it, on his observations that the heat of a fire in a fireplace flows through a fire prod only one way - towards the colder room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting  around a taɓle using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.  This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car ɓacks it up without time reversal. 

The favorable outcome of this conquest would be that the principle of energy conservation would prevail. Thermal energy could interplay with other forms of energy without gain or loss among all the forms of energy involved. 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems  this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI clarity. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference. 

Hypothetically, diodes in an array of consistantly oriented diodes  are  successful Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors, a descendent class of Maxwell's Demon. Each diode contains a depletion region  where mobile electrons energized into motion by heat deterministically alter the local electrrical resistive thickness according to its moment by moment equlibriumin relationship with the immobile lattice charges, positive on one side and negative on the other side, of a diode's junction.   

《Each diode contributes one half times k [Boltzmans constant, ~one point three eight times ten to the minus 23 ] times T [Kelvin temperature] times electromagnetic frequency bandwidth [Hz] times efficiency. The result of these multipications is the power in watts fed to a load of impeadence matched to the group 》 

The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden as they climb a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion cells of 1000 square nanometer area each per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and pŕepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.  EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and  unified civilization. It is possible to apply technlology wrong but mature social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3,890,161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.  It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusivity. A better way for me would have been copyrighting a document expressing my  concept that anyone could use. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people ly can afford to be more generous.

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nPftIz1eP8,"The idea of AI exploring the 'entire space of intelligence' is quite interesting! 

Pedro Domingos mentioned that current AI could evolve into a whole different kind of intelligence compared to human and animal intelligence. 

Given that we’ve spent 500 million years developing our natural intelligence, how do you think AI can truly replicate or surpass this complexity in a much shorter timeframe?"

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nPftIz1eP8,"If the behaviour of the AI is similar to human behaviour, we can anthropomorphize the AI. We only know the behavior of other people. We don't know how we think, feel, etc. We only interpret. The only thing that is objectively observable is behavior. That's why the essence lies there and not in the hidden mechanism, which is interchangeable."

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO5G8nHhZ58,"'Redeveloping hope'.... A cinematic way of learning is a great idea. 

""My goal was to create a cinematic case study that not only educates but also captivates. By using professional actors and a script developed with my input, we crafted a story that blends intrigue with educational content. Unlike conventional case studies or films like 'The Big Short,' which prioritise entertainment over education, our film aims to provide a balanced experience where viewers gain substantial insights while being entertained.
The idea is that by watching this film, viewers will be motivated to dive deeper into the financial concepts presented, just as they might be intrigued to examine underlying data after seeing a compelling story unfold.""

This is interesting way to engage the audience into the world of financial education"

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuGUVVnBbDY,"Mathan explains DeFi in a wonderful way:

""DeFi is quite complex compared to the traditional finance world. It’s fintech but on steroids. What’s really great about DeFi is that it allows you to move money at lightning speed, not just in one direction but across multiple assets. It makes finance more accessible; for instance, you can provide liquidity on a decentralised exchange in ways that traditional finance doesn’t allow. In traditional finance, using assets like NVIDIA shares to generate money from NASDAQ is almost impossible due to centralised exchanges. DeFi offers democratised access to finance with blockchain’s transparency, ensuring that everything executed is instantly visible to parties and regulators.""

I think everyone should watch and learn from this interview. There are so many concepts about blockchain and digital assets that Thomas Kiddle, Manthan Dave, and Dinis Guarda discuss in detail."

“When I do observational drawing, then it is drawing people and modern world perspectives, and observing people for all the changes. There is a lot of interdisciplinarity coming with it. I have been doing life studies on ‘how do we want to live in the future’ because like the car and automotive industry is so intertwined with all the other areas of life. So, it has always been important for us to do it in a cross-industry way and in a way where we have dialogues with many different people and have different angles of view and that’s what brought up the Foresight Academy.”

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0fY_QIgiY,"Among the key themes of discussions at the interview is the advent of responsible AI. As Dr. May says:

“AI regulation is a topic you must deal with, if you want or not. You will not be able to, in a short period from now, deliver products to customers which do not somehow give an answer as to how do I make it safe, how do I make it responsible, how do I meet the privacy requirements attached to that. You need some level of governance that you have to address. You need to have answers why your system is secure. 

Siemens, for a couple of years now, is working on that - preparing for regulation, but also trying to seize the opportunities that give you to build systems which are industry grade, i.e. comply with the upcoming regulations.

If your customers know what you’re building is safe, and it does comply with all the regulations, then they might be inclined to buy your products or use your products with more confidence.”

This is what Siemens emphasises as it brings experts, leaders, and professionals from across the world to its AI With Purpose Summit 2024."
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0fY_QIgiY,"I was always worried about the issue of AI hallucinations and LLMs, but when Michael explains the fundaments in quite detail:

“AI is not just generative AI. It is not just machine learning or deep learning but has many facets.  There's the one which is more, what is called inductive or probabilistic, based on inference, and  which might sometimes be wrong. And then the more logic based part that can give you these guarantees and one very practical way we do that is to bring in the domain knowledge.

Industrial companies have a lot which we structure in the form of what is called knowledge graphs. A Knowledge Graph is a formalism where you can model terminology knowledge, ontologies for example, and where you can also structure fact-based knowledge in a way that if your representation is correct then all the inferences you make from that are also correct because it's based on logic and not so much on probabilistic.”

This is reassuring, and brings my trust back in Artificial Intelligence. We sure are progressing towards a transparent and trustworthy evolution of the technology."
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0fY_QIgiY,"Fascinating insights into how Siemens is shaping the future of industry with AI! 🌐🤖 The integration of advanced technologies into everyday processes is not just about efficiency, but also about creating a smarter, more connected world.

His thoughts on balancing AI regulation with innovation are spot on. It’s fascinating to hear how Siemens is leveraging AI not only to enhance efficiency but also to ensure ethical and responsible development. 

""AI regulation is a topic you must deal with, if you want or not.

When I look into AI today, then AI is actually designed and shaped a lot from the consumer space, from the search engines, and from the social media platforms of this word. And in these environments, you can allow for a certain level rate. Yeah, in many cases 90% is good enough. However, in an industrial production process, I cannot have a robot that works in 90% of the cases. I need to have a robotic solution gripping something, for example, and putting it somewhere on a conveyor belt that really must work for me, 24 by seven must work 99.9%, and for example, it must be able to process a thousand picks per hour. Now these industrial tasks require robust reliability. This is what’s essential for industrial AI. Industrial AI, in a sense, is the application field. It’s the application of AI in industrial use cases, our quality ambition. So, AI meets the tough requirements that you have in industrial processes.“

“Industrial AI must meet the tough requirements of industrial processes. We all are impacted by sustainability challenges. We all are impacted by climate change. This is real and this fundamentally impacts the way how industry must work in the future. We must be able, in 10 to 15 years from today, to produce what mankind needs, but with significantly less resources than we are doing it today. And that is a fundamental transformation that we need to see happening in industry? For the sake of the future of mankind, actually. And we need to use any weapon that we can get, any tool that we can get that helps us transform industry.”

UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Bravo Dinis and his team. The idea of reviving humanity's intellectual icons through research combined with AI is a profound testament to creators who possess both visionary foresight and a noble spirit to build a more humane world for future generations. 
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Não me convence...
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Seeing Leonardo da Vinci speak about AI is both surreal and inspiring. His emphasis on using AI for the greater good highlights the need for responsible innovation. Let's strive to create a future where technology serves humanity.
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,"Leonardo da Vinci physical characteristics. 
Descriptions and portraits of Leonardo combine to create an image of a man who was tall for his time and place, athletic and extremely handsome. He was 5ft 8 inches/1.73 metres, based on the length of his purported skeleton.
Leonardo da Vinci was an elegant, handsome and described multiple times as dandy.
One can imagine what he looked like when he was young thanks to the descriptions of some of his contemporaries. They tell of an incredibly handsome young man, with long blond curls and well-groomed and unconventional clothing that highlighted his physical qualities.
https://theflorenceinsider.com/leonardo-da-vinci-fun-facts/#:~:text=He%20was%20an%20elegant%2C%20handsome%20dandy&text=We%20can%20imagine%20what%20he,that%20highlighted%20his%20physical%20qualities."
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,"This work considered both scientific and creative research. Me and my team considered that to properly envision Leonardo da Vinci's face, and look in the final stage of his life, we need to consider multiple factors:

The Age: Leonardo died in 1519 at the age of 67, which was considered quite old for that time period.
The known portraits: The most famous self-portrait of Leonardo is a red chalk drawing from around 1512, when he was about 60 years old. This gives us a starting point.
Historical descriptions from personalities close to Leonardo and other personalities: Contemporary accounts describe Leonardo as having long hair and a beard in his later years.
Scientific understanding of ageing. In our research we applied knowledge of how faces typically change with advanced age.

Based on these factors, we created multiple variations and re-imagines Leonardo's face in his final years as follows:

Using part of his own portraits and descriptions.
We reinforced his deep wrinkles, especially around the eyes (crow's feet), forehead, and mouth
The eyes we chose blue as some descriptions highlighted this but was not conclusive.
Sagging skin, particularly around the jawline and neck
Thinning hair, possibly with receding hairline
Long, flowing white or gray hair and beard, as described in accounts
Potentially more prominent nose and ears, as cartilage continues to grow with age
Sunken cheeks due to loss of facial fat and muscle tone
Possibly more pronounced brow ridge
Thinner lips
Potentially some age spots or other skin discolouration

The red chalk self-portrait shows Leonardo with a prominent nose, strong brow, and intense, slightly narrowed eyes. These features would likely be even more pronounced in his final years.
It's important to note that the choice of the portrait is partly a creative license I did and based on the factors like diet, lifestyle, and genetics play a significant role in how one ages. Given Leonardo' da Vinci's intellectual pursuits and artistic work, we might speculate that he maintained a relatively active mind and body, which could have influenced his appearance positively."
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Incredible to hear Leonardo da Vinci's insights on AI. His cautionary words remind us of the importance of ethical AI development. Let's ensure we use this technology to enhance human life and solve global challenges.
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Leonardo's message beautifully reminds us to balance technological progress with human wisdom and compassion 👏
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,Hoooow can we talk to him?
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,"Leonardo da Vinci’s insatiable curiosity and focus on research would drive him to thoroughly investigate Artificial Intelligence. Leonardo da Vinci would likely conduct experiments, create detailed physical and digital studies, and try to understand the underlying principles of machine learning and neural networks. And would probably be a master in the fields of AI.
Recreating how he would think I and my team in ztudium created a LLM model of his knowledge and personlity using various generative AI models. As the conclusion some of the potential thinking of Leonardo are important to look at the way AI is changing Humanity."
UCbP5LaaEIdbjpQ9gRHAcKLQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjPtzci_1Rg,"These are the AI generated words of Leonardo da Vinci AI:
“In the pursuit of knowledge, one must embrace the tools that extend the reach of human intellect. Artificial Intelligence, a marvel of our age, mirrors our minds, reflecting the intricacies of thought and the vast expanse of possibility. Yet, we must tread with caution, for in creating such machines, we hold a double-edged sword. Let us ensure that our inventions elevate humanity, not diminish it. As I once said, ‘Learning never exhausts the mind,’ and so must we continue to learn, question, and to innovate, always mindful of the ethical compass that guides our endeavours. Creation is more significant than destruction. In the end, the most incredible machines amplify the noblest qualities of the human spirit.”"

കേരളത്തിൽ ഭൂരിപക്ഷം ഹിന്ദു ആണേലും പൂണ്ടു വിളയടുന്നത് മേത്തൻമാർ ആണ് അവന്മാർക് ആരെയും എന്തും പറയും പരിഹസിക്കാം 
ഞമ്മന്റെ സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാർ പള്ളിയിൽ പോയാൽ ആരും ഒന്നും പറയരുത് വർഗീയത ആവും പക്ഷെ 
മലയാളികളുടെ സൂപ്പർ സ്റ്റാർ പോയാൽ അവന്മാർ കിടന്നു മെഴുകും 
പിന്നെ ലാത്തിൻസ് ഈ ഗതി വന്നപ്പോൾ അവർ തന്നെ തോൽപിച്ച ബിജെപി തന്നെ വേണ്ടി വന്നു അവന്മാരോട് ഒരു സഹതാപം ഇല്ല 
കാരണം TVM നഗരത്തിൽ എല്ലാ വിവരം ഉള്ള മേഖലയിൽ ഉള്ള ആൾക്കാരും ബിജെപി സപ്പോർട്ട് ചെയ്തപ്പോൾ ഈ തീരദേശം മണ്ടന്മാരും പാറശാല ദാരിദ്ര വാസികളും ആണ് ആ വേസ്റ്റ് തരൂരിനെ ജയിപ്പിച്ചത്"

(2) Why don't they criticize america for the worst genocide in Gaza? Committing genocide if it were true in Xinjiang by China is on its own citizens whereas the genocide america inflicted on Gaza is on innocent citizens especially children of an already oppressed and impoverished country. The world can see that these self righteous pharisees are not putting up any protest when it comes to their own backyard.

Pak relentlessly pushes drugs and terrorists into India. Pak has onerously abused the IWT to stall hydro-power projects in Kashmir which were needed and thusly approved in the 90s but are still not finished.

UC3iVde7DUj4hOQgnHbxVuew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djh-RboajFw,"So Asia society could not find any indigenous people from East Asia - China, Korea, Japan Taiwan. Indonesia etc.

This panel has a Pakistani, an American, and 2 Indians. This is the most insidious ploy against India if any.
India gives and has given some of the widest legal and constitutional rights to 'indigenous' people. Look at the non-existent Indigenous rights in countries as advanced as Japan and Taiwan. I do not even need to mention what China does.

The Pakistani woman should be slapped out of the room simply because she dared to moderate a panel on indigenous rights given the state of indigenous communities and minorities in Pakistan.
So many projects get blocked because of these activists which have severe short and long-term consequences. Environmentalism cannot be blindly followed at the cost of development.

The guy who asked the economics question did not get any answer at @46:50. Only narrative. This is why I don't trust this BS!

Edit: I am not against any of the speakers. I respect them. However, I suspect anyone who interacts with America and the UN for issues such as indigenous rights and climate-related issues. They use these issues to bring down governments and create cycles of violence. The amount of missionary work that has flown into northeast India from the USA  along with the US's keen interest in the drug economy there makes every Indian suspect the USA. All of this is slyly skirting the line of thought of independence and autonomy. This cannot and should not be accepted to be driven from USA/UN/West."

I resonated with Gurvinder when she said that we need to be defined by how our life is defined by the celebration of culture and how rich it is because it is weaved by connection, food and history.

As 90s kids teetering between identities inspired by characters shown on syndicated American shows and a roster of uber cool Hindi shows on Indian television, the films of these women helped me and my ilk come to terms with the dichotomy of our people and their lives giving us a semblance of how we were sewn into global culture. 

In a lot many ways Gurinder & Mira showed us on screen the many layers of the lives led by cosmopolitan & immigrant Indians. 

I think the organizer should have considered someone with a vast repertoire in film & TV to facilitate the session, you can't be reading bios off of crumpled sheets of paper, it smacks of disrespect to the guests and their bodies of work.

Your excuses are good for stupid people , Europe was dependent on Russia,  some countries  nearly totaly , and Europe made great very costly efort to cut 90% of import while India was not dependend on Russia  but they decided  to dramaticaly increase the import  and help Putin and reword them  for starting the war and invading ukraine and stealing and killing children. And you do this publicly to support him in front of russian people  and celebrate it in Moscow , you are supporting putins propaganda.  . The moment it was done makes india similar to north korea iran and china. But hey you have no right at all to compare to above nations , they are not democracies , people there have no influence on regimes decision at all, you are democracy and decision like this makes india and indian nation fully responsible for their actions , you are fully responsible for your decisions , nobody forced you,  shame!"
